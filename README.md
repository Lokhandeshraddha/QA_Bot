# QA_Bot
AI-powered Question Answering Bot using HuggingFace Transformers and OpenAI API.  Demonstrates LLM integration with APIs for intent-based QnA on custom context. 
# LLM-Based Question Answering Bot

An AI-powered Question Answering system built using Hugging Face Transformers.  
The application uses a pre-trained LLM to answer user queries based on a given context, demonstrating practical LLM integration for real-world use cases.

Features
- LLM-powered Question Answering
- Uses Hugging Face `pipeline` API
- Custom context-based responses
- Ready for UI integration using Gradio

 Tech Stack
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Gradio (for UI)

Use Case
This project showcases how Large Language Models can be integrated into applications to build intelligent, context-aware systems—aligned with modern AI engineering roles.
